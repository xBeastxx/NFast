##  What is NFast?

**NFast PRO** is a premium desktop application for secure, high-speed file transfers using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. Built on the battle-tested [croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc) protocol, NFast provides military-grade encryption with a stunning modern interface.

Unlike cloud-based services (WeTransfer, Google Drive), your files **never touch any server**. They travel directly from your device to the recipient, encrypted with PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange) cryptography.

##  Features

###  **Military-Grade Security**

|---------|-------------|
| **ZERO LIMITS** | **Send 1GB, 100GB, or 1TB. No file size restrictions. No throttling.** |
| **End-to-End Encryption** | PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange) ensures only sender and receiver can access files |
| **Zero Knowledge** | No servers, no logs, no metadata collection |
| **Direct P2P Transfer** | Files travel directly between devices - nothing stored in the cloud |
| **Encrypted Relay Fallback** | If direct connection fails, encrypted data routes through relay (unreadable to relay) |

### The Croc Protocol

NFast uses the **croc** protocol, which provides:

1. **PAKE Key Exchange** — Generates shared encryption key from a simple code phrase
2. **Automatic NAT Traversal** — Works behind firewalls and routers
3. **Relay Fallback** — If direct P2P fails, uses encrypted relay (relay cannot decrypt)
4. **Data Integrity** — SHA256 hash verification ensures files arrive intact

---

##  Configuration

### Custom Relay Server

For enterprise use or enhanced privacy, you can use your own relay:

1. **Host a croc relay** on your server:
   ```bash
   croc relay --ports 9009,9010-9013
   ```

2. **In NFast**, go to **Settings** → **Custom Relay Address**

3. **Enter your server address**: `your.server.ip:9009`

> ⚠️ **Note**: NauticGames™ does not provide support for custom relay configurations.

### Language Settings

Switch between **English** and **Spanish** in **Settings** → **Language**

---

##  Auto-Updates

NFast PRO includes automatic updates from GitHub Releases:

1. On launch, the app checks for new versions
2. If available, you'll be notified
3. Updates download and install automatically on next restart

### Manual Update

Download the latest version from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/xBeastxx/NFast/releases).

##  FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is NFast truly private?</b></summary>

**Yes.** NFast operates on a zero-knowledge architecture:
- Files are **never uploaded to any server**
- All transfers are **end-to-end encrypted**
- We collect **no logs, metadata, or analytics**
- Your data stays **only on your device** (LocalStorage)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What's the maximum file size?</b></summary>

**Unlimited.** NFast has no file size restrictions. Transfer 1KB or 100GB — it's all P2P.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does the recipient need NFast installed?</b></summary>

**For the best experience, yes.** However, technically they could use the raw `croc` CLI if they know the protocol. NFast just makes it beautiful and easy.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens if my connection drops?</b></summary>

The transfer will pause. When you reconnect and retry with the same code, the transfer **resumes from where it left off** (if the sender is still online).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use NFast for commercial purposes?</b></summary>

NFast PRO is licensed for personal and internal commercial use. See our [Terms of Service](./eula.txt) for full details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does Windows Defender flag the installer?</b></summary>

This is a **false positive** common with unsigned Electron apps. NFast is safe. You can:
1. Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
2. Or submit the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) for verification
