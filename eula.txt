6. P2P NATURE AND RELAYS
You acknowledge that NFast PRO uses a Peer-to-Peer architecture. Transfer speeds and stability depend on your and the receiver's internet connection. The Software may utilize "Relay" servers (public or private) to establish connections. While content is End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE), connection metadata (IP addresses) may be visible to the Relay server to facilitate the handshake.

Custom Relays are strictly for advanced users utilizing self-hosted or third-party infrastructure. NauticGames™ is not responsible for the performance, security, or availability of any custom relay address entered. We do not provide technical support for connection issues arising from the use of custom relays.

7. REFUNDS
As a downloadable digital software product, all sales are final, unless otherwise specified by the distribution platform's (e.g., Steam, Microsoft Store, App Store) consumer protection policies.
